# Today's Front Pages

[@FrontPageBot](https://twitter.com/FrontPageBot)

This bot posts the day's front pages once every day. Content is obtained from [Newseum](http://www.newseum.org/).


## TODO

+ Build two lists of tweets that alternately get tweeted on the half hour -- most popular, least popular
  + Most popular tweets are refined by # of retweets, favs and requests
  + Least popular tweets are randomly chosen from list of lowest ranked
  + Most popular are initially ranked by [circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_newspapers_in_the_United_States_by_circulation)
+ Request a paper by city/state (request by paper name initially complete)
+ Reply to multiple Twitter users
+ Research newseumâ€™s posting schedule
+ Add state via database of some sort, and account for that when fetching tweets/pages
